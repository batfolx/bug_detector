# bug_detector

<p> 
  A small project/model I'm working on to detect small household annoying bugs (camel crickets, centipedes, silverfish, etc).
</p>

<p>
  I plan on making a mechanism to eventually be able to destroy these bugs using Tensorflow and some robotics stuff.
  Because who wants to manually exterminate camel crickets?
